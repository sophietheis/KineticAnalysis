# Translation kinetic analysis

Here, you can find the code used to analyse fluorescence intensity fluctuations of translation sites.   
Track have to be generated with fiji and trackmate pluging.   


This project is a collaboration between [Mounia Lagha's](http://www.laghalab.com/) and [Tim Saunders'](https://mechanochemistry.org/Saunders/MainSite/Saunders_lab_v4_3.htm) teams.
